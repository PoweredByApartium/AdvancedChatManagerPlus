ACMP ideal functionality:

ChatFilter:
- Allows filtering "bad words".
- Allows filtering advertisements like links, IP addresses and such.
- Allows key-word blocking to avoid things like player/admin doxing.
- All this system should be ran through Config.yml

ChatChannels:
- Allows permanent channels that are both saved in memory & configuration file.
- Allows ephemeral channels like party channels and such for temporary purposes.
- Allows admin penetration for dynamical and security purposes.
- permanent chat channels are saved on Config.yml.

ChatControl:
- Allows message manipulation of players.
- Allows the concept of "Uwuifying" players messages and such.
- Allows mass message deletion to replace clear-chat concept.
- Allows specific player clear chat, mass clear chat & "clear my chat"

Chat Messages:
- Allows usage of placeholders, for example: PlayerName: [item] -> will show the player's item in hand. This feature also needs PAPI support for future updates.
- Allows Chat Clickable & Hoverable messages, for example: if I click on players name of his message, it will prompt in my chat "/msg [playername] ".
- Can add infinite amount of Prefixes, Suffixes and for players.
- IN THE FUTURE -> Add support for message translation.
  if in the near future we can make the plugin connectable to an AI model, we can make sure people can get their messages translated to understand languages they don't know.


Architecture:
- 1 Main API module that basically takes control of all data control.
  The best example is that each DB module will be having the data interface classes extended in them, and do their own functionality.
